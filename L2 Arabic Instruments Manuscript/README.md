##  These are data files associated with the manuscript, "Instruments Measuring Motivation to Learn Arabic as a Second Language: Evidence of Validity and Reliability". They include two survey datasets - one for the pilot, and one for the main study - and a transcript of data from the qualitative analysis. The survey datasets are anonymized and were downloaded directly from SurveyMonkey. The item wording is included in the form of headings in the dataset. The transcripts use the same aliases as used in the manuscript to identify participants.
